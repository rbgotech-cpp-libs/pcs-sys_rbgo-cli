This is a class with all static calls; it is expected that only one "instance"
exists for any application. +
Always start with initialize() and end with restore().

m|static void initialize();
|Prepares for altering the CLI mode. Backs up current mode for restore when done.

m|static void inputBlock(bool b);
|Determines if input system calls like getchar() block and wait for input or
return immediately.

m|static void inputEcho(bool b);
|Determines if user input is echoed to screen.

m|static void inputBlockEcho();
|Will call inputBlock(true) and inputEcho(true).

m|static void inputNoBlockNoEcho();
|Will call inputBlock(false) and inputEcho(false).

m|static void outputNoBuf();
|Sets the output buffer to NULL, so that output is send to screen immediately.
